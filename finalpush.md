## 📱 **1. WhatsApp Message Numbers Strategy**

### **Numbers That Could Be Shown:**
1. **Matching Keywords Count**: "Found 2 matching keywords: 'product', 'management'"
2. **Missing Keywords Count**: "Missing 8 key job requirements"
3. **Achievement Quantification**: "3 quantified achievements found"
4. **Action Verbs Used**: "8 strong action verbs detected"
5. **Customization Opportunities**: "5 bullet points need customization"

### **Numbers to Avoid:**
- ❌ "Job Fit Score: 28/100" (confusing)
- ❌ "Confidence: 6.2%" (misleading)
- ❌ Any percentage scores (not actionable)

### **Recommended Approach:**
Show **actionable counts** that help users understand what to improve, not abstract scores.

## 🧠 **2. Using 6.2% Overlap to Guide LLM Feedback**

### **Internal Analysis (Not Shown to User):**
```
JD-Resume Overlap: 6.2%
- Job Keywords: ['director', 'enterprise', 'multi-phase', 'strategic', 'leadership']
- Resume Keywords: ['product', 'management']
- Missing: 8/10 key requirements
```

### **LLM Guidance Strategy:**
1. **Low Overlap (0-20%)**: "This resume needs significant customization for this role"
2. **Medium Overlap (21-50%)**: "Some alignment found, but key improvements needed"
3. **High Overlap (51%+)**: "Good alignment, focus on fine-tuning"

### **Feedback Tone Based on Overlap:**
- **6.2% = Very Low**: Emphasize customization, keyword addition, role-specific improvements
- **Focus on**: "This role requires different language and experience positioning"
