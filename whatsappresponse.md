# WhatsApp Resume Review Response System

## Overview
This system delivers resume feedback via WhatsApp, strictly grounded in the content of Aakash's newsletter articles. It dynamically parses job descriptions (JDs), matches resume content to JD requirements, and provides feedback only based on what is present in the newsletter(s).

---

## 1. Newsletter-Grounded Review
- **All feedback is based solely on newsletter article content stored in the backend.**
- No generic resume advice or hardcoded frameworks are used.
- The reviewer persona is "Aakash" and the response style reflects his voice as found in the articles.
- If a user requests feedback on a topic not covered in the newsletter, the system will state that explicitly.

---

## 2. Job Description (JD) Parsing
- Users provide a JD URL (from any platform).
- The system extracts:
  - Role title
  - Key qualifications/skills
  - Company name
- No assumptions are made about the role type; all logic is derived from the JD content.

---

## 3. Relevance Scoring
- **Confidence score** is calculated as follows:
  - 70% weight: Keyword overlap between resume and JD
  - 30% weight: Semantic similarity between resume/JD and newsletter content
- The score reflects how well the resume aligns with the JD, using only newsletter-grounded criteria.
- Initial implementation uses a simple keyword-based approach.

---

## 4. Review Structure (LLM Output)
1. **Overall Fit + Confidence Score** (e.g., "78 / 100")
2. **Strengths** – with quotes or logic grounded in the newsletter
3. **Gaps / Areas to Improve** – grounded in article content
4. **Next Steps / Suggestions** – optional, if relevant in the newsletter
- Each section cites the specific article/section used.

---

## 5. Fallback Handling
- If the newsletter does not cover a requested topic, the system will state: 
  - "I haven't covered [topic] in my content yet, but here's what I can help with..."
- No outside or generic advice is provided.

---

## 6. System Flow
1. User submits resume and JD URL
2. Resume text is extracted
3. JD is parsed for role, skills, company
4. Relevant newsletter content is retrieved (chunked/embedded)
5. Relevance score is computed
6. LLM prompt is constructed using only newsletter content
7. LLM generates WhatsApp-ready review, citing articles
8. WhatsApp message is sent to the user

---

## 7. Scalability
- The system is designed to support multiple newsletter articles in the future, with chunking and embedding for efficient retrieval and matching.

- **`core/whatsapp_prompt.py`** - Remove remaining persona functions 
- **`api/whatsapp_upload.py`** - Add JD URL handling, newsletter integration
- **`routes/whatsapp_response.py`** - Update message formatting for new structure

### Functions/Logic to Remove:
- ❌ All `get_role_context()` functions
- ❌ All hardcoded `GROUNDING_CONTENT` constants  
- ❌ All persona/archetype logic
- ❌ All default templates and frameworks
- ❌ "6 Key Principles" references

**File: `core/newsletter_manager.py`**
- Store current newsletter content (existing Aakash article)
- Content chunking and semantic retrieval
- Citation tracking for specific sections
- Future: Multi-article support with embedding

### B. Job Description Parser  
**File: `core/jd_parser.py`**
- Universal web scraper for job posting URLs
- Extract: role title, qualifications, skills, company
- Handle multiple platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed, company sites)
- Structured output for prompt construction

### C. Relevance Scoring Engine
**File: `core/relevance_scorer.py`**
- Keyword-based scoring (70% JD-resume overlap, 30% newsletter relevance)
