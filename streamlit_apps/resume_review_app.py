# Hardcoded grounding content from Aakash's newsletter
GROUNDING_CONTENT = """The #1 mistake people make in trying to get interviews? Sharing a generic resume or customizing poorly. There are 6 key principles of customization:

1. **Recast our experience to become ideal** - Ask "What archetypes of person would the hiring manager be ecstatic to hire?" Then re-cast as many details as possible to become that person.

2. **Re-tell our story to be a straight line** - Make your winding path seem like a straight line to the job. Remove or minimize jobs that don't fit the archetype.

3. **Customize every bullet for the job** - If bullet points aren't positioning you for the job, the space can be better used. Developer experience might be more exciting than activation lift for internal tools roles.

4. **Use the keywords the ATS seeks** - AI Resume Screening systems look for keyword existence, not meaning. Cover all the bases the job description mentions.

5. **Drop examples to intrigue** - Create a compelling reason to interview you. Drop enough storytelling so they want to follow-up.

6. **Flip your weaknesses** - Identify common reasons you might get disqualified and flip them into strengths through narrative and bullet points."""
